// src/utils/llm.ts
// This file will later host the LLM factory or a more generic callLlm function.
// For now, specific provider logic has been moved to src/llm/gemini-provider.ts

// Re-export CallLlmOptions if it was defined here and is still needed globally,
// or ensure it's part of the new LlmGenerationOptions in src/llm/types.ts.
// For now, we assume LlmGenerationOptions from src/llm/types.ts is the way forward.

// Placeholder for where the factory might go or a new generic callLlm
export {}; // Ensure it's treated as a module
